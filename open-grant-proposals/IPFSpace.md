**Name of Project:**`IPFSpace`

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `ZhangPeibin`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** YES

# Project Description

IPFSpace aims to provide a data sharing platform based on the network disk model. We are currently facing several problems with traditional online disks:

- The download speed is controlled by the service provider
- Data link is easy to expire
- Centralize storage of data brings insecurity
- Data cannot be effectively shared
- Identity authentication information is controlled by the service provider

We adopt a decentralized authentication scheme, use IPFS&FILECOIN as the storage layer, and provide transparent pay-as-you-go IPFS&FILECOIN node selection.The uploaded data will be filled in metadata and the CC protocol certification will be completed. The data signed by the CC protocol will enter the shared pool according to the metadata.The data added to the sharing pool will be introduced into the native token Likecoin, as long as the data points you share and download are liked, you can get Likecoin.Data providers can provide valuable data and use Like coin for fees. You can also use Like coin to buy data.


## Value

At present, the infrastructure of IPFS&FILECOIN is continuously expanding, which has also promoted the rapid growth of users' storage requirements. Starting from the network disk model close to the user, guide users to use the IPFS&FILECOIN storage network.

Close to users, you can get more questions about the real storage of IPFS&FILECOIN, and optimize and improve them.
Based on the economic model of the native token Like, IPFSpace can bring power to data sharing and promote the migration of high-quality content from traditional storage platforms to IPFS&FILECOIN. With the continuous production of data, the metadata of joint data is a big data sharing platform based on IPFS&FILECOIN.Of course, the data is not closed, and the data that accepts the CC agreement can be queried through the api. There are bound to be many difficulties in the generation and widespread use of new cross-age agreements. We want to promote the development of the entire ecosystem together with users as a leader.

## Deliverables

IPFS has three components: networkDisk and dataSharing and dataQuery

NetworkDisk: 
-	Multiple user authentication methods
-	Invalid login to upload data
-	File encryption
-	Automatic classification of picture categories
-	File History Modified Version
-	Automatically generate car file
-	Multiple IPFS node selection
-	Filecoin backup
-	One-click automatic backup of the optimal node 


DataSharing: 
-	Authentication of user licenses / licensed agreement 
-	File metadata can be customized and edited 
-	Like coin account binding
-	Data calibration price
-	Query the content of the sharing pool
-	Pay the data with Like Coin

DataQuery:
- Api for User client to search self data with metadata 
- Api for Public data searched by User client and other search platform

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We are keen on the construction of the IPFS&FILECOIN ecosystem. We will use this project to upgrade and maintain our core products. There will be operations to mine user needs and iterate functions, and perform code upgrade. What we currently lack most is getting funds to carry out all-round route development functions.

## Relevant Experience

I have 9 years of Internet development experience. All of my product IPFSpace aims to solve user pain points. In the just-concluded Filecoin Grant 1 Hackathon, IPFSpace and I won the third prize. We are very optimistic about IPFS&FILECOIN, and we also play our part in its ecological construction with biggest effort
