# Project Description

IPFSpace aims to build Decentralized DataSharing Infrastructure. 

IPFSpace‘s mission: “To store the world's data and share it to the world.

We are currently facing several problems with traditional online disks:

- The download speed is controlled by the service provider
- Centralize storage of data brings insecurity
- Data link is easy to expire
- Data cannot be effectively shared
- Identity authentication information is controlled by the service provider
- Junk data and too much duplicate data make it too difficult to obtain value data

Solution:

- IPFS and Filecoin are used as our storage underlying protocol
- Protocol Labs IPFS & Filecoin will be used for us to provide stable free storage nodes
- Textile and pinata are also provided as data backup nodes
- NFT is used as the value of data and supports on-chain transactions
- Like chain reward economy is used for data download, like
- Data can be searched by ipfs browser through CC protocol and metadata

Our core is to build a database of human time, from which everyone can obtain the data they want, and the data can be stored safely for a long time.
The data in the library can be valuable, allowing those who need it to pay. At the same time, you can also increase the ranking of the data through interactions such as likes, and you can get sharing rewards from it.


## Value

At present, the infrastructure of IPFS&FILECOIN continues to expand, which also promotes the rapid growth of user storage requirements. Starting from the storage needs close to users, guide users to use IPFS&FILECOIN storage network.

In the world of web2, data is often unavailable (http 404), value data cannot be effectively shared, and various platforms perform non-human processing of data. We want to build a human archive through IPFS&FILECOIN. Through the leadership of IPFS&FILECOIN, to achieve the goal that cannot be achieved in the http era.

## Deliverables

IPFS has three components: DataStore and DataSharing and DataQuery

DataStore : 
-	Multiple user authentication methods
-	Invalid login to upload data
-	File encryption
-	Automatic classification of picture categories
-	File History Modified Version
-	Automatically generate car file
-	Multiple IPFS node selection
-	Filecoin backup
-	One-click automatic backup of the optimal node 

DataSharing: 
-	Authentication of user licenses / licensed agreement 
-	The establishment of a data metadata world
-	Data sharing economy system is established
-	Data NFT trading system establishment
-	Data sharing platform established

DataQuery:
- Api for User client to search self data with metadata 
- Api for Public data searched by User client and other search platform

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We are keen on the construction of the IPFS&FILECOIN ecosystem. We will use this project to upgrade and maintain our core products. There will be operations to mine user needs and iterate functions, and perform code upgrade. What we currently lack most is getting funds to carry out all-round route development functions.

## Relevant Experience

I have 9 years of Internet development experience. All of my product IPFSpace aims to solve user pain points. In the just-concluded Filecoin Grant 1 Hackathon, IPFSpace and I won the third prize. We are very optimistic about IPFS&FILECOIN, and we also play our part in its ecological construction with biggest effort
