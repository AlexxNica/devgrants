# Project Description

IPFSpace aims to build Decentralized DataSharing Infrastructure. 

IPFSpace‘s mission: “To store the world's data and share it to the world.

We are currently facing several problems with traditional online disks:

- The download speed is controlled by the service provider
- Centralize storage of data brings insecurity
- Data link is easy to expire
- Data cannot be effectively shared
- Identity authentication information is controlled by the service provider
- Junk data and too much duplicate data make it too difficult to obtain value data
- Data sharing and data economy are difficult to combine

Solution:

- All data are built on the next protocols that power the web3 (IPFS,Filecoin,Textile,NFT.storage,Web3.storage)
- Decentralized registration brought by blockchain
- Decentralized Sharing based on Token Economy System
- Decentralized Searching based on data's metadata （also rewards on Token Economy System）
- Data generates NFT and on-chain transaction

Our core is to store and share humanity's data . IPFS-based content addressing will be an index of data, and the metadata of data will be a secondary index of data. Everyone can obtain the data they want and share their existing data and obtain token economic rewards through sharing behaviors, and the data can be stored safely and stably for a long time.
The humanity's data will have its own economic reward model. Anyone can get benefits from sharing,data interaction and can also act as a data verifier to determine the quality of the data to obtain benefits, and at the same time to maintain the data high quality.


## Value

We know the correct strategy is to develop authentic power users.
At present, the infrastructure of IPFS&FILECOIN continues to expand, which also promotes the rapid growth of user storage requirements. We start from being close to the storage needs of users, and attract users to our platform by establishing a selected data set based on IPFS&Filecoin.
IPFS-based content addressing and the community’s validator system allow our database to store the most valuable piece of data. Introduce Token economic rewards, promote high-quality data storage, and promote data sharing behaviors to attract users from centralized storage to the IPFS&Filecoin decentralized storage system.

## Deliverables

IPFS has four main compenets: 

Decentralized Registry & Decentralized storage: 
-	Use DID protocol to reimagined for a user-centric web
-	Encrypt private data through decentralized user authentication
-	Perfect cross-platform interactive experience
-	Multiple reliable IPFS storage node options( NFT.storage, Web3.storage,Textile,Pinata)
-	Use Filecoin for safe, durable and reliable storage and retrieval of data

Decentralized Sharing : 
-	Decentralized user license agreement signing
-	Establish a metadata infrastructure for data
-	Data sharing token economy system is established
-	Data NFT trading system establishment

Decentralized Searching:
- Search by data metadata
- The search weight of the data is weighed by the metadata and the weight of the record on the chain
- Shared data can be accessed by search engines via ShareAPI
- Private data is searched through private API interface

## Development Roadmap

Milestone 1-$20,000

Decentralized Registry & Decentralized storage: 

-	Use IDX to reimagined for a user-centric web
-	Encrypt private data through decentralized user authentication
-	Use web3.storage to provide  IPFS&Filecoin storage services (nft.storage added )
-	Add Textile and Pinata to as another eliable paid IPFS storage node options 
-	Cooperate with FileCoin miners to provide FileCoin storage solutions(In progress)
 

Decentralized Sharing

- Authentication of user licenses / licensed agreement 
- Add metadata to each data 
- Build sharing darhboard
- Build data sharing platform
- Build data sharing platform
- Mint the NFT from data's metadata
- Data NFT trading system establishment (opeansea)
- Data sharing economy system design

  
Milestone 2-$10,000

Decentralized Searching:

- Search by data's metadata
- Data is sorted by weight
- Build ShareAPI 
- Build PrivateAPI


## Total Budget Requested

* Milestone 1: $20,000

* Milestone 2: $10,000

Total: $30,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We are keen on the construction of the IPFS&FILECOIN ecosystem. We will use this project to upgrade and maintain our core products. There will be operations to mine user needs and iterate functions, and perform code upgrade. What we currently lack most is getting funds to carry out all-round route development functions.

## Relevant Experience

I have 9 years of Internet development experience. All of my product IPFSpace aims to solve user pain points. In the just-concluded Filecoin Grant 1 Hackathon, IPFSpace and I won the third prize. We are very optimistic about IPFS&FILECOIN, and we also play our part in its ecological construction with biggest effort

# Additional Information

We already have some users and have been following the development of our project. As we know, the correct strategy is to develop authentic power users. We will always proceed from the perspective of users and reflect IPFS&Filecoin in the best possible way
