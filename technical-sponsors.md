# Technical Sponsors for Grant Applications

Technical sponsors are a pathway for closer guidance, collaboration, and support and collaboration between grantees and domain experts.

For most open and RFP grant applications, technical sponsors are optional. The only exception is for projects that seek to modify core protocols or codebases: if your project includes PRs to core implementations such as go-ipfs or lotus, or depends on FIP approval, a technical sponsor is required.

### Submitting your application with a technical sponsor

- Before submitting your application, you should have their verbal agreement. (You may wish to send them a link to the Technical sponsor responsibilities.)

- Once you’ve created the Github issue with your application, the sponsor should add a comment confirming their willingness.

That’s it! The Grants WG will reach out to the sponsor during the review process.

### Technical sponsor responsibilities

Technical sponsors should be core contributors of the relevant project in the Filecoin, IPFS, or libp2p ecosystems. Agreeing to be a technical sponsor means taking on the following responsibilities:

- Confirm your sponsorship via a comment on the application's Github issue.

- The Grants WG will ask for your review comments (usually via writing).

- Provide project guidance along the way. This can take many forms, from regular video calls to less-frequent email exchanges.
 
- As each milestone is complete, confirm your approval via a comment on the Github issue. The Grants WG will use this approval to release the milestone payment to the team.

For any questions, email grants@filecoin.org or ask in the #grants-help channel on the Filecoin Slack.
